          <p style="color:#510051; text-align:justify" class="well">Babies who are breastfed have a lower risk of diseases like allergies, obesity, respiratory  infections, uranary tract infections, cot death.
              Hence, they are less likely to be hospitalised.
              Breastmilk is perfect food for babies as it has got important ingredients to build the baby's immune system.
              Breastmilk is more easily digested due to which breastfed babies are rarely constipated and are less likely to get diarrhoea.
              Breastmilk is environmentally friendly since it has no waste products.
              Breastmilk is economical as it can save money.
              Breastfeeding has significant health benefits for mothers and can help mother to lose weight after baby's birth.</p>

          <p style="color:#510051; text-align:justify" class="well"> Malnutrition is the condition that occurs when an individual body does not get    enough nutrients.
              Malnutrition can occur if you do not have enough food.
             Starvation is a form of malnutrition.
             Symptoms vary and depend on the cause of malnutrition. Some general symptoms include fatigue,dizziness and weight loss.
             As per the WHO data, 3,58,000 women died due to pregnancy and 7.6 million children under the age of five died in 2010 because they were not breastfed.
             Many more millions suffer from infectious diseases and malnutrition, never reaching their full potential because tey were bottlefed.</p>

         Indian government do not have a proper data collection to know whether mothers are initiating breast-feeds in first hour of life after
         birth and continuing it for at least six months.
       It is an Indian Government initiative in collaboration with Institute Of Informatics and Communication (I.I.C.), Delhi University.
       The purpose of this initiative is to help government collect the data by building up a software based module, so
       that doctor, nurse, mother or relative will give information about breastfeeding and introduction of solid foods.
       The data thus collected will be further analysed for providing better health facilities in India.</p>

                        There is a global effort by UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) to implement practices that protect, promote and support breastfeeding. It aims to ensure that all maternities, whether free standing or in a hospital, become centers of breastfeeding support. Hospitals and maternity units set a powerful example for new mothers.
The "Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding" are the foundation steps which summarize the maternity practices necessary to support breastfeeding. A maternity facility can be designated 'baby-friendly' when it does not accept free or low-cost breastmilk substitutes, feeding bottles or teats, and has implemented these 10 specific steps to support successful breastfeeding.

                        The first step states that Every facility providing maternity services and care for newborn infants should have a written breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated to all health care staff. The health facility should have a written breastfeeding policy that addresses all the ten steps and protects breastfeeding. It should be available so that all staff who take care of mothers and babies can refer to it. Also it should be visibly posted in all areas of the health care facility which serve mothers, infants, and/or children and should be displayed in the language(s) most commonly understood by patients and staff. The ten steps call for health facilities to have written policies that are displayed for all to read, indicating that staff is committed to implementing them. The first step is to have a written breastfeeding policy in English and the local languages. It addresses all the ten steps and states that the hospital does not accept free or subsidized supplies of infant formula and feeding bottles. The policy is communicated to the hospital administration as well as to all the health workers in the maternity setting.

                      The second step says that Every facility providing maternity services and care for newborn infants should Train all health care staff in skills necessary to implement this policy. All health care staff who have any contact with mothers, infants and/or children must receive instruction on the implementation of the breastfeeding policy. Training in breastfeeding and lactation management should be given to various types of staff including new employees, it should be at least 18 hours in total with a minimum of 3 hours of supervised clinical experience and cover at least 8 steps. Training at all levels should address the ten steps, breastfeeding, counselling, and the International Code. A policy is of no use unless it is implemented So the second step is to train all doctors and nurses in skills necessary to implement this policy. It ensures that the majority of the staff members are trained in breastfeeding counselling.

                       Third step is to Inform all pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding. If the hospital has an affiliated antenatal clinic or antenatal ward then breastfeeding counseling should be given to most pregnant women using those services. The antenatal discussion should cover the importance of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 4-6 months, the benefits of breastfeeding, and basic breastfeeding management. Pregnant women of 32 weeks or more gestation should confirm that the benefits of breastfeeding have been discussed with them including at least two of the following benefits: Nutritional, protective, bonding, health benefits to the mother and that they have received no group education on the use of infant formula. They should be able to describe at least two of the following breastfeeding management topics: importance of rooming-in, importance of feeding on demand, how to assure enough milk, and positioning and attachment. By the time a baby is born, the new mother must be comfortable about breastfeeding, understand its benefits, and what she has to do. The third step is to have sessions with pregnant women to motivate them for breastfeeding and to remove all their doubts.

                      <div class="accordion-inner">
                      The fourth step states that Every facility providing maternity services and care for newborn infants should Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within a half-hour of birth. Mothers in the maternity ward who have had normal vaginal deliveries should confirm that within a half-hour of birth they were given their babies to hold with skin contact, for at least 30 minutes, and offered help by a staff member to initiate breastfeeding. At least 50% of mothers who have had caesarean deliveries should confirm that within a half-hour of being able to respond, they were given their babies to hold with skin contact. Place babies in skin-to-skin contact with their mothers immediately following birth for at least an hour and encourage mothers to recognise when their babies are ready to breastfeed, offering help if needed. It is now well established that mothers who are supported to initiate breastfeeding soon after the baby is born are more likely to have a successful breastfeeding experience. So the fourth step is to initiate breastfeeding within a half–hour of birth.

                      <div class="accordion-inner">
                        The fifth step is to show the mother how to maintain lactation by expression of breast milk or to visit her baby in the intensive case as often as possible. Nursing staff should offer further assistance with breastfeeding within six hours of delivery and mothers should be shown how to express their milk or given written information on expression and/or advised where they could get help, should they need it. Mothers with babies in special care should be helped to initiate and maintain lactation by frequent expression of breastmilk. Staff should teach mothers positioning/attachment and techniques for manual expression of breastmilk. Helping mothers to breastfeed effectively with a good technique is a vital step. If infants are separated from their mothers, or are unable to suckle, their mothers need to express their milk. Health workers need skills to help mothers do these things. A situation can arise when the baby has to be separated from her mother for a specific medical reason.

                      <div class="accordion-inner">
                        The sixth step stresses that a newborn baby must not be given any food or drinks other than breast milk unless it is medically indicated. As the pregnant women are counseled in advance and the hospital staff is trained, we rarely have to give anything other than colostrums – the first breast milk to the babies. For any breastfeeding babies being given food or drink other than breastmilk there should be acceptable medical reasons. No promotion for infant foods or drinks other than breastmilk should be displayed or distributed to mothers, staff, or the facility. Families and health workers may believe that infants need pre-lacteal feeds of formula or glucose water or other drinks before their mother's milk "comes in." This may lead to failure to breastfeed. Infant formula and advertisements in maternities can mislead people on this important point. Breast milk is pure and complete, while giving babies water or other liquids can pose risks due to contaminated water.

                      <div class="accordion-inner">
                     The seventh step about rooming–in is very important. Unless medically indicated, the baby remains with the mother 24 hours a day. Unless the mother is heavily sedated, she keeps the baby next to her in her bed.Mothers with normal babies (including those born by caesarean section) should stay with them in the same room day and night, except for periods of up to an hour for hospital procedures, from the time they come to their room after delivery (or from when they were able to respond to their babies in the case of caesareans). It should start no later than one hour after normal vaginal deliveries. Normal postpartum mothers should have their babies with them or in cots by their bedside unless separation is indicated. In many hospitals, newborns are kept in nurseries after delivery. Rooming-in allows mothers and their babies to stay together day and night to bond and to establish breastfeeding.

                       The eighth step is about Encouraging breastfeeding on demand. Mothers of normal babies (including caesareans) who are breastfeeding should have no restrictions placed on the frequency or length of their babies' breastfeeds. They should be advised to breastfeed their babies whenever they are hungry or as often as the baby wants and they should wake their babies for breastfeeding if the babies sleep too long or the mother's breasts are overfull. Babies should feed according to their needs, not a schedule decided by the hospital or mother. Understanding her infant's feeding cues improved breastfeeding and the mother-child relationship. According to the eighth step the mother is encourage to breastfeed whenever the baby wants to. This is called demand feeding. It helps in increased production and prevents undue engorgement of breasts.

                    The ninth step rightly prohibits the use of feeding bottles and pacifiers. Give no artificial teats or pacifiers (also called dummies or soothers) to breastfeeding infants. Infants should not be fed using bottles with artificial teats (nipples) nor allowed to suck on pacifiers. During the early weeks, the baby's need to suckle should be satisfied at the breast. Using teats or pacifiers may interfere with suckling and the adjustment of the breast milk supply to the baby's requirements.

                     The tenth and the last step is to Foster the establishment of breastfeeding support groups and refer mothers to them on discharge from the hospital or clinic. Mothers breastfeeding should be explored for their plans for infant feeding after discharge. They should also be able to describe one thing that has been recommended to ensure that they will be linked to a breastfeeding support group (if adequate support is not available in their own families) or report that the hospital will provide follow-up support on breastfeeding if needed. The nursing officer in charge of the maternity ward should be aware of any breastfeeding support groups in the local area and, if there are any, describe a way mothers are referred to them. Alternatively, she or he should be able to describe a system of follow-up support for all breastfeeding mothers after they are discharged (early postnatal or lactation clinic checkup, home visit, telephone call). Breastfeeding support groups are often part of a community nutrition strategy. Peer counsellors are women from the community who receive training in breastfeeding support. They often contact mothers in their homes. They are very effective in increasing exclusive breastfeeding. After the mother is discharged from the hospital, she needs much support to breastfeed. She may have doubts if she was producing enough milk or she may have problems like engorgement or sore nipples. Hence, the tenth step recommends to either put the mother in touch with a breastfeeding support group or to help her have free access to someone in the hospital for advice as and when required.
