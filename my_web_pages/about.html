<h3>Breastfeeding :</h3>
<p>Breastfeeding is the feeding of an infant with breast milk which is direct from femal human breasts rather than using infant formula from a baby bottle or some other container.</br>
According to experts, children should be breastfed wiithin one hour of birth, exclusively breastfed for the first six months and then breastfed until age of two. Apart from that, </br>
those babies should also be provided with age-appropriate, nutritionally adequate foods. Under modern health care, human breast milk is considered the healthiest form of milk for </br>
babies. Breastfeeding promotes health for both mother and infants and helps to prevent disease. Longer breastfeeding has also been associated with better mental health through </br>
childhood and into adolescence.</p>
</div>

<div class="well">
<h3>Benefits for a Breastfed Infant :</h3>
<p>Breast milk provides the ideal nutrition for infants. It has the perfect mix of vitamins, proteins and fats which are required by the infant to grow. These all nutrients are provided</br>
in an easily digestible form. Breast milk contains antibodies which help baby fight off viruses and bacteria. Breastfeeding reduces baby's risk of having asthma or allergies. Babies who</br>
are breastfed exclusively for the first six months have very fewer ear infections, respiratory illnesses. They have also fewer hospitalisations and doctor trips. Breastfeeding is also </br>
linked to higher IQ in later childhood. Breastfed infants are more likely to gain right amount of weight as they grow rather than become overweight children.</p>
</div>

<div class="well">
<h3>Benefits for Mother :</h3>
<p>Breastfeeding burn extra calories so it can help mother to lose pregnancy weight faster. Breastfeeding reduces the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Since neither the measurement </br>
formula is required nor the nipples or warm bottles, breastfeeding helps in saving time and energy. Deciding to breastfeed provides mother with regular time for relaxing quitely with</br>
newborn as she grows close and emotionally bonded with her infant.</p>

<h3>Some Information about Malnutrition :</h3>
<p>47 percent of India&rsquo;s children below the age of three years are malnourished (underweight). The World Bank puts the number probably conservatively at 60 million. This is out of a global estimated total of 146 million. 47 percent of Indian children under five are categorised as moderately or severely malnourished.
South Asia has the highest rates and by far the largest</br>number of malnourished children in the world. The UN ranks India in the bottom quartile of countries by under-1 infant mortality (the 53rdhighest), and under-5 child mortality (78 deaths per 1000 live births). According to the 2008 CIA fact book, 32 babies out of every 1,000 die before their first birthday.At least half of Indian infant deaths are related to malnutrition, often associated with infectious diseases.
Malnutrition impedes motor, sensory, cognitive and social development, so malnourished children will be less likely to benefit from schooling, and will consequently have lower income as adults. The most damaging effects of under-nutrition occur during pregnancy and the first two years of a child's life.  These damages are irreversible, making dealing with malnutrition in the first two year crucially important. A close reading of available statistics shows the problem to be far from uniform.</p>

<h3>WHO Recommendations on Breastfeeding :</h3>
<p>According to WHO, national authorities in each country decide which infant feeding practice should be promoted and supported by their maternal and child health services to avoid </br>
HIV infection tranmission from mother to child. The vast majority of mothers can and should breastfeed, just as the vast majority of infants can and should be breastfed. Only under </br>
exceptional circumstances can a mother's milk be considered unsuitable for her infant. For those few health situations where infants can't, or should not, be breastfed, the choice </br>
of the best alternative-expressed breast mik from an infant's own mother, breast milk from a healthy wet-nurse or a human-milk bank, or a breast-milk substitute fed with a cup, which</br>
is a safer method than a feeding bottle and teat-depends on indidvidual circumstances. The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the six months of life, after which "infants </br>
should recieve nutritionally adequate and safe complementary foods while breastfeeding continues up to two years of age or beyond."</p>
